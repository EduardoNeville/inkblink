# PROMPT d4522a64-a377-41cd-873b-b7f192ab2702


I want to create an icon generation website. I wanna use supabase as my backend.

The website will use inkbucks as a currency used to control user usage.
Each generation of an icon is 1 inkbuck, each styling is one inkbuck, each edit is one inkbuck too.

Icons come in packs, a user is able to add icons to that pack and have them look similar.

I want you to help structure my database so that i can track the users inkbuck usage as well as store the
icons they create, style, and edit inside supabase. How can I do this? I would like to be able to 
store the icons inside the database as well as keep track of the packs used by the users.

To structure your database efficiently in Supabase, you'll need tables to store user data, track Inkbucks usage, organize icons into packs, and keep records of generated icons. Below is a proposed structure:

---

### **Tables & Relationships**

#### **`users`** (Stores user information)
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `email` (Text, Unique)
- `username` (Text, Unique)
- `inkbucks` (Integer, Default: 0)
- `created_at` (Timestamp)

#### **`icon_packs`** (Stores icon packs)
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key â†’ `users.id` ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `name` (Text)
- `created_at` (Timestamp)

#### **`icons`** (Stores generated icons)
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key â†’ `users.id` ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `icon_pack_id` (UUID, Foreign Key â†’ `icon_packs.id` ON DELETE SET NULL)
- `image_url` (Text) **(Path to Supabase Storage)**
- `metadata` (JSONB) **(Store additional icon data â€“ styling, size, format, etc.)**
- `created_at` (Timestamp)

#### **`transactions`** (Tracks Inkbuck usage)
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key â†’ `users.id` ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `type` (Text, Enum: `'generate' | 'style' | 'edit'`)
- `icon_id` (UUID, Foreign Key â†’ `icons.id` ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `amount` (Integer, Negative for spending Inkbucks)
- `created_at` (Timestamp)

---

### **Additional Considerations**
1. **Storage**
   - Store the actual icons in **Supabase Storage** (e.g., `/icons/{user_id}/{icon_id}.png`) and save the reference (`image_url`) in the `icons` table.
   
2. **Inkbuck Usage Logic**
   - Deduct 1 Inkbuck per action (generation, styling, editing) and create an entry in `transactions` table.
   - Ensure **database triggers** or Supabase **Row-Level Security (RLS)** rules enforce that users never have a negative balance.

3. **Fetching User Data Efficiently**
   - Example query to fetch user icon packs with icons:
     ```sql
     SELECT ip.id, ip.name, 
            json_agg(i.*) AS icons
     FROM icon_packs ip
     LEFT JOIN icons i ON ip.id = i.icon_pack_id
     WHERE ip.user_id = 'user-id-here'
     GROUP BY ip.id;
     ```

This setup ensures:
- **Scalability:** JSONB columns can store flexible metadata.
- **Tracking & Auditing:** Transactions ensure inkbuck deductions are recorded.
- **Relational Integrity:** Icons belong to packs, and packs belong to users.
